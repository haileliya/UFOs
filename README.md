# UFOs
Built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.  Customized my webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with visualizations. 

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis was to use javascript and html to scrape the internet for findings related to UFOs and compile the data onto a database and relay this data on a webpage for easy access. I used javascript to scrape the information for data that was stored as an array and created HTML code to customize a webpage that allows users to filter through the data by parameters. The webpage can be accessed at :http://127.0.0.1:5500/static/js/index.html

Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. 

As you can see in the webpage, there is a lot of data to sift through, which can become cumbersome. Therefore, in order to reduce the burden on users, I input a filter on the left hand side of the screen that allows for easy data analysis. Users can filter by date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO. There are placeholders in these fields as examples of how to use these filters.

Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

After refractoring this code, we removed the actual button to filter, which we would need to put back in order to properly use this. 1) I think that it would also be usefull to search by key words in the comments section and duration. 2) I also recommend that users are able to filter data with more than one filter at a time will be even more beneficial for cross-tabulation of the data.
