Built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.  Customized my webpage using Bootstrap, and equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with visualizations.
